ðŸŽ® Game Concept
You're the new night guard at "Freddy's Forgotten Pizzeria", a long-abandoned family restaurant with a dark secret. The animatronics still roam the hallsâ€”but theyâ€™re not just broken machines. Something else is controlling them.

Your goal? Survive until 6 AM using security cameras, limited power, and quick reflexes. But hereâ€™s the twist:

The animatronics learn. They adapt to your tactics over time.

Phantom glitches distort realityâ€”whatâ€™s real and whatâ€™s in your head?

A hidden lore unfolds through cryptic messages and corrupted tapes.
